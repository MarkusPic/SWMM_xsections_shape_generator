# SWMM CrossSection shape Generator

Generate cross-section shapes for SWMM using fundamental shapes (like straight lines and cyrcles).

This application should help you to generate cross-sections for the US-EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM).

To understand the general usage of shape curves in context to cross-sections,
read the documentation of SWMM provided on the [official website of EPA](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm).
